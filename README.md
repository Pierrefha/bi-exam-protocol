# bi-exam-protocol

- protocol of the business intelligence/bi exam that took place in 21.07.2021.
  Created one because no protocol did exist yet.

# prerequisites
- The following tools have to be installed:
    - groff
    - ps2pdf
    - make

#### Systems
- Linux: These tools are usually preinstalled on most distros.
- MAC OS: Tools can just be installed.
- Windows: I think you have to use WSL.

# build the pdf
- Run make to build the pdf.
```shell
make
```

# cleaning up the folder
- Run make clean to remove the compiled files.
```shell
make clean
```
